# Lab 1

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

## Knitting & Embedding Code Chunks
When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

##Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. By default 'echo' is set to TRUE to show the code that generates plots. There is another parameter 'eval' that by default is set to TRUE to show the code that creates results.

## Your Assignment
In this lab, you will use the R CheatSheet and any online resources to:

1. create an RMarkdown file that will be knitted as a word document you turn in;
2. read in your multivariate data set;
3. use the **head** function to show the columns and first several rows of your dataset;
4. create a bulleted list describing the columns in your dataset and the type of variable that each column represents (e.g., ordinal, categorical, continuous, etc. per the lab lecture slides);
5. and create a plot of some of your data.

Please be sure to show all code and results in your knitted word document. Also, create sub-headings for tasks 2-5 above.
